# database-management-systems

This is a class project I did with my friends for Database Management Systems class at MUICT. We start from developing business requirements to coding an SQL database. Here's a brief list of what we did.

1. Business domain and business analysis
2. Summarising business requirements and/or functions
3. Designing relational schema
4. Drawing ER diagrams
    1. Chen diagram
    2. Crow foot diagram
5. Setting up an SQL database
6. Some queries

In this repository, I have a PDF file which is a whole report of what we did, all the diagrams, and some query codes. The code doesn't include the setting up part, however.

Enjoy! :D
